READ ME:
The game is played by using the arrow keys to move, the 'z' key to pick up items, the 'x' key to drop items, and the 'spacebar' to use items. The goal of the game is to collect the three hidden keys to unlock the boss door and fight the boss. Once the boss is defeated, press the spacebar to advance the dialogue of the visual novel.



WALKTHROUGH (To only be used if absolutely necessary):
1. Move up a screen and press z on the brown bocarina to grab it. Press space to play it, but be warned, the song it plays is terrible. This will be important later.

2. Move up another screen to the room with the big door and the three locks. You will need to find three keys to unlock the three locks. You can press x to drop the bocarina here for later use. 

3. Grab a stick from the wood pile using z, and bring it to the brazier in the top left of the room, and press the use key (space) to make a torch. This will illuminate the dark room to your left when you walk in. Light the brazier in the dark room to permanently illuminate the room.

4. Grab the sword on the ground of the dark room. You can now kill the enemy in the room to the left of you. Grab the blue key and use it on the door two screens to the right.

3. Take the sword and go to the right of the door room. Use the sword to cut down the grass door. Grab the ice spell from the newly unlocked room. Go back to the dark room, that is now illuminated, and now go down. Use the ice spell in this room to create a path across the lava. Go down once more. You'll now be in a room with a shield and key. Take the key from the room and once again use it on the big door.

4. Go back and grab the shield. Now go right of the room with the big door. Go down from here, and the charging enemy can be pushed into the pit using the shield. Advance to the right and grab the last key. Use it on the big door.

5. The final boss room is now unlocked. Grab the bocarina and use it in the boss room to kill the boss.

6. Enjoy the visual novel. Press the space bar(space) to advance the dialogue.
